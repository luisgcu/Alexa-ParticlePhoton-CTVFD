# Particle Photon Modbus Master. 

The project basically have been created as draft that allow Control techniques VDF  drives M200, M300, M400, M600  fitted with Modbus RTU 485 interface, to be connected to a Particle -Photon  using   RS485 driver. The sample program provided in this project allow to read several VFD Modbus registers at a configurable poling time. Every time the VFD Register is pooled then is send to particle cloud in json format, and to MQTT server.Two particle function have been programmed allowing to Start/Stop VFD motor , get motor speed, and get VDF temperature.

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
